## Welcome to DYNAMICON


### Here, you can buy your own Trading Card NFT

We will give you a short instructions on buying your own trading card NFT. Feel free to come to us if you have any questions or need help buying your trading cards. Feel free to add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlo-seppi-0a2222169/)!

### Step 1
First, download [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/download/) and add a wallet. 

### Step 2
Important: Don't do it on the mainnet! We have everything on to Rinkeby Testnet. Change the network on the Metamask wallet.
