Hint: Press on the images. These are youtube videos which show you what to do...

### Step 1
To interact with the blockchain, you will need a wallet where you can access your cryptocoins. We will give an explenation on how to buy some of the NFTs using the Metamask wallet. To do so, download the [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/download/) and add a wallet (following the description). 

### Step 2
The Metamask uses Ethereum (ETH). The ETH you know from the news is on the mainet. Interaction with the ETH blockchain costs money. However, sometimes people first want to try their program without paying for it. For this, there exist the Testnet. You can get free ETH and test your programs without any financial consequences. 
You can buy the Trading Cards on the Testnet. To this end, go to your Metamask wallet and change the network to *Rinkeby Test Network*.

### Step 3
To buy the NFTs you will need some ETH. On the side [https://rinkebyfaucet.com/](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/) you can get free ETH for the Rinkeby Testnet. Copy your Address from your wallet and paste it onto the website. They will send you the free ETH.

### Buy Trading Cards!
Everything is done on the smart contract. We added the option that if you send some ETH to the smart contract, it will automatically mint the NFT for you. To do so, send 0.001-0.3 ETH to this Address (1 card costs 0.001 ETH):
